- 👋 Hi, I’m @LaelDavis
- 👀 I’m interested in topics such as Machine and Deep Learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the mathematics dealing with multivariate calculus and linear algebra to better understand ML algorithms. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal closely with work in recommendation/recommender systems. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Just shoot out an e-mail to "laeldavis21@yahoo.com" and I'll try to get back to you shortly. 
Thanks!
